The test file list_test.c has been added.

A make file is provided. You can test your code with list_test.c with 'make test'.

Keep in mind that file contains a main() method, so please do NOT add a main() in your own list.c file.

If you would like to debug the "test" code, add following line to the main of list_test.c after you created the runner:
srunner_set_fork_status (sr, CK_NOFORK);

Now you can set breakpoints in your own code and check the value of your variables.
