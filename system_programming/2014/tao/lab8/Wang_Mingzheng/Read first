There are to folders 'client' and 'server' containing two programs.
For each program I used shared library and there is a makefile in each folder to update the executables.
Initially, all the executables needed have been generated and ready to use, you can just run them.
And the 'sensor.data' in 'client' has been generated by 'simulator' and ready to be sent by 'client'.
