there are two file for this task.
one is the the normal memory dump and the other one is its extended version

1. for the standard memory dump, the start address and number of bytes are asked for input.

2. for the extension, if no are argument is given, it works the same as the standard memory dump
   once the start address and numbers of bytes are given as arguments, it will print without asking for input.
   
   e.g. " ./a.out 0x4001e6 -30 " will work fine.  (your address argument must be "0x......" format)
